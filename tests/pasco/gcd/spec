GCD of univariate polynomials with integer coefficients.


Problem specification:

The problem is to compute as quickly as possible the gcd of two
univariate polynomials with integer coefficients.  Participants
are free to use any piece of software for integer arithmetic or
polynomial operations or any other library of their choice.


Specification of the program input/output:

The participant must provide a program with the following specification:
    * Polynomial file storage format: a polynomial having N non-zero terms
      will be stored in a file having N+1 lines.
    * First line: the number N of non-zero terms
    * Each of the following lines will contain the degree of a term
      followed by its coefficient.  These are separated by a space.
      The terms will be given in order of descending degree.

For example, the polynomial 10*x^4 - 11*x^3 + 12*x^2 - 13 would be

4
4 10
3 -11
2 12
0 -13


Usage: To compute gcd(A,B) = C, run the program

  gcd A B C

where the arguments A, B and C are files storing polynomials
