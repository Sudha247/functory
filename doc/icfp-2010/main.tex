\section{Introduction}

what it is and what it is not
\begin{itemize}
\item it is not a library which does parallelization
\item it is a library for reliable distributed execution of
  parallelizable computation 
\end{itemize}

inspired by Google's MapReduce~\cite{mapreduce} (itself inspired by functional
programming, ironically) ;  however, there are differences:
\begin{itemize}
\item polymorphic, higher-order API
\item more generic (cores/network)
\item does not focus on association lists
\item we don't have data locality (future work)
\end{itemize}

what is the target audience/applications: 
for instance, use if automatic provers on thousands of verification
conditions, on computing infrastructures which can be
\begin{itemize}
\item a single machine with multiple cores, possibly remote
\item several machines, small or large in number, over a network
\end{itemize}

master and worker terminology introduced here

a few technical details about marshaling should be explained

\section{API}

The main idea is to start with a generic function, with the
following interface: 
% TODO: rename this function
\begin{ocaml}
  val compute : 
    f:('a -> 'b) -> 
    handle:('a * 'c -> 'b -> ('a * 'c) list) -> 
    ('a * 'c) list -> unit
\end{ocaml}
This function takes two functions, \ocaml{f} and \ocaml{handle}, and a
list of \emph{tasks} of type \ocaml{('a * 'c) list}.
The function \ocaml{f} is applied to the first component for each task.
Whenever it completes, the task and the result are passed to the
function \ocaml{handle}. This may possibly generate a new list of
tasks. The process ends when all computations are done.

Function \ocaml{f} should be pure and is executed in parallel.
Function \ocaml{handle}, on the contrary, can be impure and is never
executed in parallel with other \ocaml{handle}s. Typically,
\ocaml{handle} stores and processes information locally.
The next section will describe the usage of this generic interface to
perform traditional map and fold operations.

Actually, our library provides more than just a single \ocaml{compute}
function as above, but instead provides five different versions
depending on the execution context. The five possible contexts are the
following: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{purely sequential execution:}
  this is intended for validating the results;

\item \textbf{several cores on the same machine:} 
  this implementation makes use of \unix\ processes and thus can
  provide a polymorphic \ocaml{compute} function;

\item \textbf{same executable run on master and worker machines:}
  this implementation makes use of the ability to marshal \Ocaml\
  closures and thus can still provide a polymorphic \ocaml{compute} function;

\item \textbf{master and workers are different programs, compiled with
    the same version of \Ocaml:} 
  in this case, we can no longer marshal closures but we can still
  marshal polymorphic values. As a consequence, 
  the \ocaml{compute} function is split into two
  polymorphic functions, to implement the master and workers respectively:
  \begin{ocaml}
val master : 
  handle:('a * 'c -> 'b -> ('a * 'c) list) -> 
  ('a * 'c) list -> unit
val worker : ('a -> 'b) -> unit -> unit
  \end{ocaml}

\item \textbf{master and workers are different programs, not even
    compiled with the same version of \Ocaml:} in this case, we can no
  longer use marshaling, so the
  \ocaml{compute} function is split into two monomorphic functions
  over strings: 
  \begin{ocaml}
val master : 
  handle:(string * 'c -> string -> (string * 'c) list) -> 
  (string * 'c) list -> unit
val worker : (string -> string) -> unit -> unit
  \end{ocaml}
  Note that the second component of each task is still polymorphic (of
  type \ocaml{'c} here).
\end{enumerate}

Our library is organized into three modules: \of{Sequential} for the
pure sequential implementation, \of{Cores} for multiple cores on the
same machine and \of{Network} for a network of machines, respectively.
The \of{Network} module itself is organized into three sub-modules,
corresponding to contexts 3, 4 and 5 above. The different
API functions are summarized in the following table (their signatures
being given above):
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \ocaml{Sequential} & \ocaml{Cores} &
    \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\ocaml{Network}} 
    \\\cline{3-5}
    &       & \ocaml{Same} & \ocaml{Poly} & \ocaml{Mono} \\\hline
    \ocaml{compute}  & \ocaml{compute}   & \ocaml{compute}  &
    \ocaml{master}  & \ocaml{master}  \\
    & & & \ocaml{worker}  & \ocaml{worker} \\\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Derived API}

In most cases, the easiest way to parallelize execution it to make use
of map and fold operations over lists, where processing of the list
elements are done in parallel.  Using the generic API described in the
previous section to do that is not very convenient.
Hence we provide the most commonly used list operations in our API.

The most obvious operation is the traditional map operation over
lists, that is:
\begin{ocaml}
  val map : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list
\end{ocaml}
The next natural operation is a combination of map and fold
operations, that is a function like
\begin{ocaml}
 val map_fold :
   map:('a -> 'b) -> fold:('c -> 'b -> 'c) -> 
   'c -> 'a list -> 'c
\end{ocaml}
which, given two functions, an accumulator \of{a} and a list \of{l}, computes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:map-fold}
  \of{fold} ... (\of{fold} (\of{fold} ~ a ~ (\of{map} ~ x_1)) (\of{map} ~ x_2))
  ... (\of{map} ~ x_n)
\end{equation}
for some permutation $[x_1,x_2,...,x_n]$ of the list \of{l}.

We assume that the \of{map} operations are always performed in parallel.
Regarding \of{fold} operations, we distinguish two cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item either \of{fold} operations are computationally less expensive
  than \of{map} and we perform them locally;
\item or \of{fold} operations are computationally expensive and we
  perform them in parallel.
\end{itemize}
We thus provide two functions \of{map_local_fold} and \of{map_remote_fold}.

In the case of \of{map_remote_fold}, only one \of{fold} operation can
be performed at a time (possibly in parallel with \of{map}
operations), as obvious from~(\ref{eq:map-fold}). However, there are
cases where several \of{fold} operations can be performed in parallel,
as early as intermediate results of \of{fold} operations are available.
This is the case when \of{fold} is an associative operation (which
implies that type \of{'b} and \of{'c} are the same  and that the
accumulator should be a neutral element for \of{fold}). Whenever
\of{fold} is also commutative, we can perform even more \of{fold}
operations in parallel. Thus our API provides two functions
\of{map_fold_a} and \of{map_fold_ac} for these two particular cases.
The five operations of the derived API are summarized
in Figure~\ref{fig:derived}.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{ocaml}
    val map : 
      f:('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list 
    val map_local_fold : 
      map:('a -> 'b) -> fold:('c -> 'b -> 'c) -> 
      'c -> 'a list -> 'c 
    val map_remote_fold : 
      map:('a -> 'b) -> fold:('c -> 'b -> 'c) -> 
      'c -> 'a list -> 'c 
    val map_fold_ac : 
      map:('a -> 'b) -> fold:('b -> 'b -> 'b) -> 
      'b -> 'a list -> 'b 
    val map_fold_a : 
      map:('a -> 'b) -> fold:('b -> 'b -> 'b) -> 
      'b -> 'a list -> 'b
  \end{ocaml}
  \caption{Derived API.}
\label{fig:derived}
\end{figure}

These five functions are actually derived from the generic API.
The generality is achieved by implementing theses derivations as a functor.
This functor, \of{Derive}, is parameterized by the \of{compute}
function, as follows:
\begin{ocaml}
module Derive
  (X : sig
     val compute : 
       f:('a -> 'b) -> 
       handle:('a * 'c -> 'b -> ('a * 'c) list) ->
       ('a * 'c) list -> unit
   end) = struct ... end
\end{ocaml}
We now explain how each function from Figure~\ref{fig:derived} is
implemented using \of{compute} inside the functor body.

\paragraph{\of{map}.} 
Function \of{map} is easily implemented by associating an integer
index with each element (of type \of{'a}) of the input list. Thus the
list of tasks passed to \of{compute} is a list of pairs of type \of{'a * int}.
As soon as an intermediate result is available, it is passed to
\of{handle}, which stores it in a local table using the index as a key
and generates no new task. Whenever \of{compute} returns, we easily
recover the output list from the values stored in the table.

\paragraph{\of{map_local_fold}.} 
Function \of{map_local_fold} is implemented using a local reference
storing the current accumulator (of type \of{'c}).
As soon as an intermediate result is available, \of{handle} 
combines it with the accumulator using function \of{fold}. Whenever \of{compute}
returns, we simply return the current accumulator.

\paragraph{\of{map_remote_fold}.}
In this case, combining the accumulator with an intermediate result is
itself a task to be performed in parallel with \of{map} operations.
Thus, when an intermediate \of{map} result is available, the
accumulator may be already in use in a \of{fold} operation. Hence we
need to store the intermediate \of{map} result in a local table, to be
used as soon as the accumulator becomes available.
The \of{handle} function distinguishes between \of{map} and \of{fold}
results and, accordingly, updates the table and the accumulator. For a
\of{map} result, either we combine it with the accumulator in a new
task or we simply store it in the local table. For a \of{fold} result,
either we simply store it into the accumulator or we immediately
combine it with a pending \of{map} result from the table.
Whenever \of{compute} returns, the accumulator must be available and
we simply return it.

\paragraph{\of{map_fold_ac}.}
Function \of{map_fold_ac} is easier than the previous one, since we do
not need to store more than one intermediate result. Indeed, as soon
as two intermediate results are available, we immediately combine them
using a \of{fold} operation. Thus the \of{handle} function 
either stores it or combines it, depending on the availability/non
availability of the accumulator.
Whenever \of{compute} returns, the accumulator must be available and
we simply return it.

\paragraph{\of{map_fold_a}.}
Function \of{map_fold_a} is definitely the trickiest. Indeed, the
operation being only associative, we can only combine \emph{adjacent}
intermediate results. In order to perform this, we store intermediate
results in a local table according to indices of the input list. More
precisely, if we have already computed
\begin{displaymath}
  x_i \oplus x_{i+1} \oplus \dots \oplus x_j
\end{displaymath}
where $\oplus$ denotes the \of{fold} operation, then we associate this
value with indices $i,j$. As soon as a result of indices $k,i-1$ or
$j+1,k$ is available, it can be combined with the result of $i,j$.
Whenever \of{compute} returns, the table should only contain a result
corresponding to the full input list and we simply return it.
